        "# ACReFOSC Demo: Generating a Preference Dataset for DPO üßë‚Äçüíª\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provides a hands-on demonstration of how to use the **ACReFOSC (A Companion REpository to the French OLDI Seed Corpus)** dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "It shows how one can construct a **preference dataset** from the provided files. This type of dataset is useful for fine-tuning language models using methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which teaches a model to prefer one style of response over another.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset Overview üìä\n",
        "\n",
        "The script will use two core files from the repository:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `acrefosc_raw.json`: This file contains the primary data. For each English source segment, it includes:\n",
        "    * The final, **human post-edited French translation** (the high-quality \"chosen\" response).\n",
        "    * Nine different **raw machine translation hypotheses** (the lower-quality \"rejected\" responses).\n",
        "    * Quality Estimation (QE) scores for each machine-generated hypothesis from two different metrics: `COMET` and `MetricX`.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `acrefosc_prompts.json`: This file contains the specific prompts used to generate the translations for the `Llama-4-Scout_segment-level` system adapted to discourage CoT.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Core Task: Creating Preference Pairs ‚úÖ‚ùå\n",
        "\n",
        "The key operation consists in creating pairs of \"chosen\" and \"rejected\" translations for each source text. The `create_preference_dataset` function in this notebook automates this process. Crucially, the code verifies that a machine-generated hypothesis is different from the human-post-edited reference before considering it as a 'rejected' candidate, ensuring no identical pairs are created.\n",
        "\n",
        "It also demonstrates several **advanced selection strategies** for choosing the \"rejected\" example, using the provided QE scores:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`all`**: The simplest approach. It creates a preference pair for every machine translation that isn't identical to the final human version.\n",
        "* **`hardest`**: A more nuanced strategy. For each source text, it selects only the *best-scoring* machine translation as the rejected example. This creates \"hard\" negative examples that are closer in quality to the chosen response.\n",
        "* **`easiest`**: This strategy selects the *worst-scoring* machine translation as the rejected example, creating a dataset with more clear-cut quality differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: The script correctly handles the fact that **MetricX is an error score, where lower is better**. Therefore, the \"hardest\" negative example will have the *minimum* MetricX score among the machine-generated options.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook will first clone the repository, then process the data to generate and save a `.jsonl` file ready for DPO training. Let's get started! üëá"
